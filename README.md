# Coca morphometrics üçÉ
A repository containing data, methods, and figures analyzing coca leaf shape

**Figure 2: Coca branches from 16 coca landraces.** Branches with leaves and seeds and/or flowers are illustrated. The four different classified varieties are indicated by color as follows: Erythroxylum coca var. ipadu, blue; E. coca var. coca, orange; E. novogranatense var. truxillense, green; and E. novogranatense var. novogranatense, red. ![alt_image](https://github.com/DanChitwood/coca_morphometrics/blob/main/png_files/Figure2.png)

**Figure 3: Coca leaves from coca landraces and wild species.** 18 randomly selected leaves are shown for each cultivar and wild species by row. The four different landraces are indicated by color (E. coca var. ipadu, blue; E. coca var. coca, orange; E. novogranatense var. truxillense, green; E. novogranatense var. novogranatense, red) as well as the four wild species (E. cataractarum, purple; E. foetidum, brown; E. gracilipes, pink; E. lineolatum, gray). Base and tip landmarks are indicated by black points and centimeter scale for each leaf is provided. ![alt_image](https://github.com/DanChitwood/coca_morphometrics/blob/main/png_files/Figure3.png)

**Figure 4: Allometry, morphospaces, and prediction for coca leaf types. A)** Allometry plot modeling length as a function of width in centimeters. Linear models and data points for each leaf type are indicated by color. The isometric line is indicated by a dotted gray line. Axes are log-scale and equal. **B)** The overall Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) means leaf (magenta) and all leaves superimposed as transparent black lines. **C)** Mean leaves (magenta) for each type (indicated by text and color) and respective leaves in transparent black outlines superimposed to their respective mean. **D)** A principal component analysis (PCA) morphospace. Eigen leaves are plotted in the background as gray outlines and leaf types indicated by color. ![alt_image](https://github.com/DanChitwood/coca_morphometrics/blob/main/png_files/Figure4.png)

**Figure 5: Comparisons among groups of coca leaves. A)** Pairwise comparisons between indicated groupings (see text and indicated colors).  The mean leaf for each group is in bold, and all leaves from the group superimposed on each other transparently. **B)** For each comparison, negative log10 p-values for each pseudo-landmark are projected onto the overall mean leaf by color (see legend). P-values are derived by comparing Euclidean distances of each point to its respective vs. general mean point. ![alt_image](https://github.com/DanChitwood/coca_morphometrics/blob/main/png_files/Figure5.png)

**Figure 6: Cultivars form three distinct morphotypes.** For each pairwise comparison of cultivars, the p-value resulting from a Kruskal-Wallis comparison of the Procrustes distances to the respective cultivar mean shape vs. the mean shape calculated from leaves of both cultivars is calculated. Hierarchical clustering on the resulting matrix of p-values reveals three distinct morphotypes. Coca variety type is indicated by color.(https://github.com/DanChitwood/coca_morphometrics/blob/main/png_files/Figure6.png)
